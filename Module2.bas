' This OCX control is made by M. Schermer from the Netherlands
' This OCX can be used to capture the fullscreen or the active
' window. I'm take no care about damage on your computer but
' that is impossible.
'
' To use this control compile it to an OCX and start an new project
' Goto COMPONENTS and add the compiled OCX file
' Now you can use it to add the control to your form and for
' example:

'   Dim FileToOpen as String
'
'   FileToOpen = CaptureScreen1.CaptureActiveScreen("C:\MyScreen.BMP", BMP, True)
'   Image1.Picture = LoadPictures(FileToOpen)
'
' PS: If you want to make a loop (for example: refresh picture every 1 second)
' check the CaptureScreen1.ReadyState
' it returns True if the process is ready
' it returns False if the process is not ready
'
'                           Have fun using this control
